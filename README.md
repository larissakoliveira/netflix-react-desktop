### Gitflow

#### My project's gitflow explained

For now I have 6 branches: **main, develop, feature/screen/login, feature/themes, feature/router, feature/readme.**
I tried to apply as much as possible these rules from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to create my commits and branches.
 
* **Main** -> has the final version to production.

* **Develop** -> contains pre-production code, used to test the application before merge it into main branch.

* **Feature/screen/login** -> used most to code LOGIN, styles, components, schemas, types, utils, all logic that was related to the login screen.

* **Feature/themes** -> used for code related to the themes, global styles.

* **Feature/router** -> used to work with all routes logic that this app needs.

* **Feature/readme** -> used to create this readme.
