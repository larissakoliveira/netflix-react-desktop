### My project's gitflow explained

For now I have 6 branches, main, develop, feature/screen/login, feature/themes, feature/router, feature/readme.

I tried to apply as much as possible these rules from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to create my commits and branches.
 
Main -> has the final version to production.

Develop -> contains pre-production code, used to test the application before merge the whole code with the main branch.

Feature/screen/login -> used most to code LOGIN, styles, components, schemas, types, utils, all logic that was related to the login screen.

Feature/themes -> used for code related to the themes, global styles.

Feature/router -> used to work with all routes logic that this app needs.

Feature/readme -> used to create this readme.
