### Description
# Netflix Project

### Gitflow

My project's gitflow explained -> for now I have 7 branches: **main, develop, feature/screen/login, feature/themes, feature/router, feature/readme, feature/redux.**
I tried to apply as much as possible these rules from [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) to create my commits and branches.
 
* **main** -> has the final version to production.

* **develop** -> contains pre-production code, used to test the application before merge it into main branch.

* **feature/screens/login** -> used most to code LOGIN, styles, components, schemas, types, utils, all logic that was related to the login screen.

* **feature/screens/shows** -> used to code everything related to list shows and get my list.

* **feature/themes** -> used for code related to the themes, global styles.

* **feature/router** -> used to work with all routes logic that this app needs.

* **feature/readme** -> used to create this readme.

* **feature/redux** -> used to create the entire logic used in redux and saga.

* **feature/guard** -> used to create guard to protect some specific routes that can be accessed only if authenticated.

* **feature/grid** -> used to style and render all shows, list shows.

* **feature/extras** -> used to try to add any extra feature, functionality.
